Interim Somnium Networked UI  

This is a snapshot of the network synchronisation UI objects that I am exploring to find the best way to sync UI and states in Somnium.

The goal is to develop a set of objects that can later be adapted for full network synchronisation, which will be implemented in the future.

The objects in this repository utilise the synced rigid body functionality of Photon Fusion 2, which is already incorporated in Somnium projects.
